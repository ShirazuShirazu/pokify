# What does the program do?

This program is used to generate a pokemon name out of an inputted person's name. 

It does this by downloading a training on a dataset of all 800+ official pokemon released, by breaking the names up by syllables and training on it with a Deep Neural Network. 
After training by syllables, the inputted person's name is also broken up and the Machine Learning model appends its predictions to the end of the inputted name.
